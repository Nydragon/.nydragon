I am a fourth year computer science student at Epitech Berlin. Linux, FOSS, Homelabbing and tinkering with my system is what I spend my time on.

I focus on writing tools in Rust and contributing to [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/).

> [!NOTE]
> I am on the lookout for an end of studies internship. If I caught your eye, please reach out to me via [mail](mailto:d99tbwy91@mozmail.com).
