# Hello There <img src="giphy.gif" height="30" loop="false">

I am a fourth year computer science student at Epitech Berlin. Linux, FOSS, selfhosting and tinkering with my system is
what I fill my days with.

> [!NOTE]
> I am on the lookout for an end of studies internship. If I caught your eye, please reach out to me at [TODO](mailto:TOOD).
